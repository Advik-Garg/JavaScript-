Console Screen: How do we print stuff on the console screen? Well, you first have to make a variable and give it some value like "var car=5" or var name="Advik". Next put console.log and in round brackets (), put the varibales name (in this case the name is car or name). That's it. You will see things printed on the console screen!!
